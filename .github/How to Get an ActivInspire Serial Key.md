# How to Get an ActivInspire Serial Key
 
ActivInspire is a software that allows you to create interactive lessons and presentations for your classroom. It comes with two editions: Personal and Professional. The Personal Edition is free to download and use, but it has limited features and functionality. The Professional Edition offers more tools and resources, but it requires a valid serial key to activate.

If you want to upgrade to the Professional Edition of ActivInspire, you need to have a serial key that matches your hardware. There are different ways to find or generate your serial key, depending on how you obtained your ActivInspire software.
 
## Option 1: Check your ActivBoard or ActivPanel
 
If you have an ActivBoard or ActivPanel from Promethean, the manufacturer of ActivInspire, you can find your serial key on a sticker located on the back or on the side of your device[^1^]. The serial key is a 20-digit alphanumeric code that starts with 0015. You can enter this code in the Promethean License Agreement window when you launch ActivInspire for the first time, along with your name and the name of your organization. You must accept the terms of the license and then click OK.
 
## Option 2: Check your email or DVD packaging
 
If you purchased an ActivInspire license through a Promethean Partner, you should have received an email with your serial key[^1^]. You can also find your serial key on the packaging of the ActivInspire Professional Edition DVD, if you bought one (no longer sold)[^1^]. You can enter this code in the same way as Option 1.
 
## Option 3: Generate a serial key online
 
If you don't have a physical device or a purchase receipt for ActivInspire, you can still generate a serial key online by using your hardware serial number and product code[^2^]. You can find these numbers on the label of your Promethean hardware, such as an ActivBoard, ActivPanel, ActivHub or ActivSlate. The hardware serial number is a 14-digit code that starts with 0 or 1. The product code is a 4-digit code that starts with PRM. Once you have these numbers, visit the [ActivInspire Upgrade page](https://support.prometheanworld.com/activinspire/upgrade) and enter them without spaces or dashes. Click Validate to generate your 20-digit Activation Key. Once generated, we recommend that you enter your details where indicated to have a copy of your Activation Key emailed to you for future reference. You can enter this code in the same way as Option 1.
 
## Option 4: Retrieve a serial key from a computer file
 
If you have already installed ActivInspire on another computer and activated it with a serial key, you can retrieve that key from an .xml file on that computer[^1^]. The file name is .inspire\_license.xml and it is located in the ActivInspire folder. The location of this folder varies depending on your operating system:
 
- Windows: C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Promethean\ActivInspire
- macOS: /Users/username/Library/Application Support/Promethean/ActivInspire
- Linux: /home/username/.promethean/ActivInspire

You will need to enable hidden files and folders to access this folder. Once you find the file, you can open it in a web browser and view your serial key. You can enter this code in the same way as Option 1.
 
## Conclusion
 
ActivInspire is a powerful software that can enhance your teaching and learning experience. To unlock its full potential, you need to upgrade to the Professional Edition by using a valid serial key. You can find or generate your serial key by following one of the options above. If you have any questions or issues with activating your software, please contact Promethean Support for assistance.
