A.I. Artificial Intelligence received mixed reviews from critics and audiences when it was released in 2001. Some praised the film's visual effects, emotional impact, and philosophical themes, while others criticized its uneven tone, ambiguous ending, and sentimental approach. The film currently holds a 75% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 199 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"A curious, not always seamless, amalgamation of Kubrick's chilly bleakness and Spielberg's warm-hearted optimism, A.I. is, in a word, fascinating.\" The film also has a 64% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes based on more than 250,000 ratings.
 
Some of the critics who gave positive reviews to the film include Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who awarded it four stars out of four and wrote: \"Stanley Kubrick always referred to the story as 'Pinocchio.' It mirrored the tale of a puppet who dreams of becoming a real boy. And what, after all, is an android but a puppet with a computer program pulling its strings?\" He also praised Osment's performance as David and Spielberg's direction as \"a masterful blend of Kubrick's vision and his own.\" Nell Minow of Common Sense Media gave the film four stars out of five and called it \"a provocative movie suitable for teens\" that \"raises profound questions about what makes us human.\" She also warned that \"the movie is very sad and may be upsetting even for mature teens.\"
 
Some of the critics who gave negative reviews to the film include David Edelstein of Slate, who called it \"a colossal failure\" and \"a work of staggering solipsism.\" He argued that \"Spielberg has taken Kubrick's dark vision and given it a happy ending that means nothing.\" He also criticized the film's depiction of women and sex workers as \"misogynistic\" and \"exploitative.\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film two stars out of five and described it as \"a gigantic piece of kitsch\" that \"isn't really about anything at all.\" He also mocked the film's ending as \"a preposterous piece of sci-fi whimsy.\"
